## Planned Extractions (Not Yet Completed)

### 6. NoteSyncManager.swift - COMPLETED (1,198 lines)

- **Purpose**: Handle all note-related sync operations
- **All Completed Features**:
  - `syncNotesToSupabase()` - Main note upload orchestration with progress tracking
  - `syncNoteMetadataOnly()` - Upload notes without binary data (insert/update logic)
  - `syncNoteWithBinaryData()` - Upload notes with binary content (direct bytea format)
  - `fetchNotesForSync()` - Fetch notes that need syncing (including deleted notes)
  - `updateSyncStatus()` - Update note sync status in CoreData with transaction support
  - `createSupabaseNoteFromCoreData()` - Convert CoreData to Supabase format (metadata only)
  - `createFullSupabaseNoteFromCoreData()` - Create full notes with binary data
  - `createEnhancedSupabaseNoteFromCoreData()` - Create Base64-encoded notes (deprecated)
  - `downloadNotesFromSupabase()` - Download notes from Supabase with progress tracking
  - `resolveNoteConflict()` - "Last Write Wins" conflict resolution strategy
  - `updateLocalNoteFromRemote()` - Update local CoreData notes with remote data
  - `downloadNoteBinaryData()` - Download binary data for notes (direct bytea format)
  - `deleteNoteFromSupabase()` - Delete notes from Supabase with file cleanup
  - `cleanupDeletedNotes()` - Clean up notes marked as deleted from Supabase
  - `cleanupOldDeletedNotes()` - Clean up old soft-deleted notes (30+ days)
  - ~~`fixAudioNoteSyncStatus()` - Fix audio notes with incorrect sync status~~ ‚úÖ **REMOVED**
  - ~~`fixPendingNotesInSupabase()` - Fix remote notes with pending sync status~~ ‚úÖ **REMOVED**
- **Integration**: Fully integrated with SupabaseSyncService using closure-based progress updates
- **Dependencies**: SupabaseService, SyncTransactionManager, NetworkRecoveryManager, ProgressUpdateCoordinator

### 7. SyncUtilities.swift (Optional)
**Status: ‚ùå NOT STARTED**
- **Purpose**: Common utility functions and extensions
- **Estimated Size**: ~100-200 lines
- **Contents**:
  - Data encoding/decoding helpers
  - Size calculation utilities
  - Common validation functions
  - Sync status management helpers

## Implementation Notes

### Key Challenges Encountered:
1. **inout Parameter Handling**: The `syncProgress` parameter needs to be passed as `inout` to allow modifications, but this creates issues with closure captures in async contexts
2. **Progress Update Threading**: Progress updates must be coordinated properly between background sync operations and UI updates on MainActor
3. **Dependency Injection**: Each extracted manager needs proper dependency injection for shared services (SupabaseService, etc.)

### Best Practices for Remaining Extractions:
1. **Maintain inout Parameters**: Keep `syncProgress: inout SyncProgress` parameters as they were in the original working code
2. **Avoid Closure Captures**: Don't capture `inout` parameters in closures - use direct assignments instead
3. **Preserve Transaction Context**: Ensure all CoreData operations maintain proper transaction boundaries
4. **Test After Each Extraction**: Verify functionality works after each module extraction before proceeding

## Current Status - REFACTORING COMPLETED! üéâ
- **Original File Size**: ~3,007 lines
- **Extracted So Far**: ~2,509 lines (SyncTransactionManager + ProgressUpdateCoordinator + NetworkRecoveryManager + SyncDataModels + FolderSyncManager + NoteSyncManager ALL PHASES)
- **Final SupabaseSyncService Size**: 689 lines
- **Total Reduction**: 77.1% (exceeded target of 70-80%)
- **Target Achievement**: ‚úÖ Successfully reduced main file to 689 lines (well within 600-900 line target)
- **All Note Operations**: ‚úÖ Fully extracted to dedicated NoteSyncManager

## Completed Steps ‚úÖ
1. ‚úÖ SyncDataModels.swift extraction completed (safest, no logic changes)
2. ‚úÖ FolderSyncManager.swift extraction completed (folder operations)
3. ‚úÖ NoteSyncManager.swift Phase 1 completed (core upload operations)
4. ‚úÖ NoteSyncManager.swift Phase 2 completed (binary data operations)
5. ‚úÖ NoteSyncManager.swift Phase 3 completed (download/conflict resolution)
6. ‚úÖ NoteSyncManager.swift Phase 4 completed (cleanup operations)
7. ‚úÖ **ALL MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETED!**

## Optional Future Enhancements
- Consider SyncUtilities.swift if common patterns emerge during future development
- Monitor for any additional sync-related functionality that could benefit from extraction
